## Informations
There is a folder named "Video" where the video stays.
There is a fodler named "Presentation" where the presentation stays.

In the folder "pointclouds" there are all the point clouds generated from the depth images from the Kinect.

In the folder "callback_files" there are the files to use a callback function to click on the keys of the virtual keyboard.

The file named "VideoColor.avi" is the video we used to finish the product and its not the Illustrative Video.

To run the code, its needed the following files:
	- main.py
	- pcd.py
	- VideoColor.avi
	- pointclouds/*

The "keyboardsegmenter.py" is the file to remove the background and get only the keyboard, which we need to manually setup with the trackbars.

The "kinect_matlab.m" is the Matlab code used in this project, which can be usefull for posterior projects in this course.
